The QED-HF reference involves the product of an electronic Slater determinant with the photon vacuum state |\\Phi_o\\rangle |0\\rangle, so single excitations can occur as electronic excitations from an occupied orbital \\phi_i to a virtual orbital \\phi_a, the raising of the photon number state from |0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1\\rangle, or both.

For the case of multiple modes, the photonic basis states will be augmented to consider all possible combinations of the occupations of those modes within a maximum photon number.  These coefficients, and the corresponding energy eigenvalues for a given QED-CIS-1 state I, may be obtained by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix built in the basis shown below in Eq. (10).
